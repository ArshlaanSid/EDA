## Overview

The **Startup Funding Analysis** project aims to analyze data on startup funding from various sources, focusing on identifying patterns, regional trends, investment rounds, and funding amounts. Through this analysis, the project provides valuable insights into the startup ecosystem, helping investors, entrepreneurs, and analysts understand how different factors impact startup growth and investment opportunities.

## Notebooks

- **Part 1: Data Exploration and Cleaning**
  - In this notebook, we import the dataset and perform extensive data cleaning and preprocessing. This includes handling missing values, formatting inconsistencies, and outlier detection.
  
- **Part 2: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
  - The second notebook focuses on performing exploratory data analysis to uncover key insights from the dataset. We visualize funding trends, identify leading industries, and investigate geographic trends in startup investments.
